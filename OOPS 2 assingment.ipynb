    "Constructors are special methods that are automatically called when an object of a class is created. They are used to initialize the attributes of the object and perform any necessary setup.

They are used to provide behaviors and functionalities to the object or the class.\n",

    "#12. Explain the concept of property decorators in Python and how they relate to encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows you to define properties in a class. A property is an attribute that has getter, setter, and deleter methods that control its access and modification. A property decorator simplifies the syntax of defining and using properties by using the @property annotation above the getter method, and the @<property_name>.setter and @<property_name>.deleter annotations above the setter and deleter methods, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A property decorator can help you achieve encapsulation, which is one of the principles of object-oriented programming. Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing a public interface for interacting with it. By using a property decorator, you can prevent direct access to the underlying attribute and enforce some logic or validation in the getter and setter methods. For example, you can check if the new value of the attribute is valid, or perform some calculations based on the attribute value. This way, you can protect the integrity and consistency of the object’s state.\"\"\"\n",

    "Compile-time polymorphism is when the compiler determines which function to call based on the number and types of arguments at compile time.

    "The isinstance(object, classinfo) function returns True if the object is an instance of the classinfo or any of its subclasses, and False otherwise. The classinfo can be a single class, a type, or a tuple of classes and types. For example, isinstance(3, int) returns True, because 3 is an instance of the int class. Similarly, isinstance(\"hello\", (str, list)) returns True, because \"hello\" is an instance of the str class, which is one of the elements in the tuple (str, list).\n",

For example, in Python, a class is an example of encapsulation, as it encapsulates all the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that belong to the class. The user of the class only needs to know the name of the class, its attributes, and methods, and how to create an object of the class. The user does not need to know how the methods are implemented or how the data is stored internally.

    "\"\"\"Abstract methods are methods that are declared but not implemented in an abstract base class (ABC). They serve as a blueprint for the subclasses that inherit from the ABC, and they enforce abstraction by requiring the subclasses to provide their own implementation of the abstract methods. For example, if you have an ABC called Polygon with an abstract method called noofsides, then any subclass of Polygon (such as Triangle, Quadrilateral, etc.) must override the noofsides method and define how many sides it has. This way, the ABC defines a common interface for all the subclasses, but the subclasses can have different behaviors according to their specific characteristics. To create an ABC in Python, you can use the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator12. You can also register unrelated classes as virtual subclasses of an ABC using the register method2.

    "#18. Explain how abstraction enhances code reusability and modularity in Python programs.\n",
    "\"\"\"Abstraction is a key feature of object-oriented programming that allows you to hide the implementation details of a class or a function and only expose the relevant features to the client. Abstraction enhances code reusability and modularity in Python programs in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction enables you to create a common interface for different implementations of a component, such as an abstract base class that defines a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses12. This allows you to use the same interface for different types of objects, without worrying about the specific details of how they work internally. For example, you can create an abstract class called Animal that defines an abstract method called move, and then create subclasses like Human, Snake, Dog, and Lion that override the move method and provide their own behavior2.\n",
    "Abstraction also allows you to create reusable and modular code that can be easily maintained and extended. By hiding the implementation details, you can change the internal logic of a class or a function without affecting the client code that uses it. This makes your code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements. For example, you can create an abstract class called Polygon that defines an abstract method called noofsides, and then create subclasses like Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Quadrilateral that override the noofsides method and return the number of sides they have1. If you want to add a new subclass like Octagon, you only need to implement the noofsides method and inherit from the Polygon class, without modifying the existing code.\"\"\"\n",

       "'Composition and inheritance are two ways of creating complex classes from simpler ones in Python. Inheritance models an “is a” relationship, where a subclass inherits the attributes and methods of a superclass. Composition models a “has a” relationship, where a class contains an object of another class as an attribute. Both of them enable code reuse, but they have different advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\nOne of the benefits of using composition over inheritance is that it allows for more flexibility and modularity. With composition, you can change the behavior of a class at run-time by changing the object it contains. For example, you can have a class Car that has an attribute engine, which can be an object of different classes like GasEngine or ElectricEngine. Depending on the type of engine, the car can have different methods and properties. You can also swap the engine object with another one without affecting the rest of the car’s functionality.\\n\\nWith inheritance, you have to define the behavior of a class at design-time by inheriting from a specific superclass. This can lead to rigid and brittle designs, where changing the superclass can affect all the subclasses that depend on it. For example, if you have a class Vehicle that has a method drive(), and you inherit from it to create subclasses like Car, Bike, and Boat, then changing the implementation of drive() in Vehicle can break the logic of the subclasses. You also have to deal with the problem of multiple inheritance, where a subclass inherits from more than one superclass, which can cause conflicts and ambiguity.\\n\\nAnother benefit of using composition over inheritance is that it promotes loose coupling and high cohesion. Loose coupling means that the classes are independent and have minimal dependencies on each other. High cohesion means that the classes are focused and have a clear responsibility. These are desirable properties for designing maintainable and testable code.\\n\\nWith composition, you can achieve loose coupling and high cohesion by delegating the responsibility of each class to the object it contains. For example, if you have a class Student that has an attribute course, which is an object of class Course, then the Student class does not need to know the details of how the course works, it only needs to interact with its interface. The Course class is responsible for handling its own logic and data. This way, the classes are independent and focused.\\n\\nWith inheritance, you can end up with tight coupling and low cohesion, where the classes are interdependent and have multiple responsibilities. For example, if you have a class Animal that has a method eat(), and you inherit from it to create subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Bird, then the subclasses have to inherit the eat() method, even if they have different ways of eating. The Animal class is responsible for handling the common logic of all the subclasses, which can make it complex and bloated. This way, the classes are dependent and unfocused.\\n\\nIn conclusion, composition is a better choice than inheritance in Python when you want to create complex classes that are flexible, modular, loosely coupled, and highly cohesive. Composition allows you to change the behavior of a class at run-time by changing the object it contains, and it delegates the responsibility of each class to the object it contains. Inheritance is more suitable when you want to create classes that share a common behavior and structure, and you want to reuse the code of a superclass.

Encapsulation means wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit, such as a class. Abstraction means hiding the internal details and showing only the functionalities of the unit. Encapsulation and abstraction are used to prevent accidental modification of data and to ensure that an object’s state is always valid.\n",
